# Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervise
## Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning dealing with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. In other words, It mirrors the functioning of our brains. Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing information.
