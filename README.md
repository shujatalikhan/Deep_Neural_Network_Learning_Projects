### Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised
### Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning dealing with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. In other words, It mirrors the functioning of our brains. Deep learning algorithms are similar to how nervous system structured where each neuron connected each other and passing information.

## Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning

* One of differences between machine learning and deep learning model is on the feature extraction area. Feature extraction is done by human in machine learning whereas deep learning model figure out by itself.

* Deep learning models tend to perform well with amount ofdata wheras old machine learning models stops improving after a saturation point.

# Note when trying to open .ipynb file if some issue occur i:e"Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" when viewing *.ipynb"
## Follow the following Steps
### 1. open "https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/"
### 2.Paste"https://github.com/shujatalikhan/Deep_Neural_Network_Learning_Projects/blob/master/Transfer_Learning_VGG16/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb" ---This is one example you can do same for any file
### 3. Then You can See the Code
