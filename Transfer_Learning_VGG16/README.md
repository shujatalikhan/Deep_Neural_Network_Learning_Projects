# Transfer Learning?
### Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task.
## Why we Use Transfer Learning?
### In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest.
## Types of Transfer Learning?
* Pre trained network.
* Fixed Feature Extraction Method
* Fine-Tunning Method
